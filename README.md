make the world better
Oct 6th, 2010
Today, I was inspired by the philosophy of Linux while reading Begining Ubuntu Linux. I plan to build a website that is more specilized than 
twitter, but more generic than Github, focusing on topics about making the world better. The spirits would be the same as Linux, namely free and share.
People can select a point which they do not like in daily life, and tell the rest of the world what they have done to solve that, including thinking, reading, learing, and the like.
Other people who are also interested in this topic can join the discussion, either by giving advices or by commit to do something on that afterwards, and then share what they would have experienced.
Focus on daily life, do real things, and share, to make the world better to you and the others.
